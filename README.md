# boilerPlate
I used HTML and CSS to design my resume. I have never used either of these languages before so it was a huge learning curve for me. I learned a lot along the way.

I struggled a lot with getting the padding correct. I am having trouble with the padding of my header. It is different than the rest and I cannot figure out why and can't fix it, I've tried everything. I also am struggling with drying up my code. I think I also might add a logo into the header but I am not sure yet.
